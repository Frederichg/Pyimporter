# Pyimporter

The Importer will open a browser to get the folder where the .csv file are located (in part already working).
He will get the name of those .csv files (note only the .csv), and check into the index.xlsx if the file as already been imported
If not, it will add the file name at the end of the index. Do the same for all new files (in part already working)
Than it will cut the file for the Origin folder and paste it to the destination folder (not tried yet)
Than save the Index.xlsx
On the GUI it can have a button to open the Index so the student can add the criterion into the different column after the import.
